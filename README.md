# The following tasks:
1. Create a class to describe a student in our group.
Class fields: first name, last name, passport number, group name (you can add your own fields if desired - for example, age).
Create objects of this class for each student in our group.
Place all these objects into an array.
Loop through the array with a for loop and print the information to the console.

2. Create a CreditCard class with the account number and current account amount fields. 
Create one constructor with two parameters.
Create a Transfer Service class - a transfer service.
Add a method that allows you to add an amount to a credit card. 
The method accepts the amount and the card as input. Inside the method, create a code that adds the amount passed to the method to the current amount on the card passed to the method.
Add a method that allows you to withdraw a certain amount from the card. 
The method accepts the amount and the card as input. Inside the method, write a code that subtracts the transferred amount from the current amount on the transferred card.
Add a method that outputs the current card information to the console.
Think over and implement various checks inside the withdrawal/added methods: for example, a negative number was transmitted, 0 was transmitted, a request for withdrawal of an amount greater than is currently on the card, and other possible checks.
Write a program that creates three objects of the CreditCard class that have an account number and an initial amount set.
Test scenario for verification: 
Put money on the first two cards and withdraw from the third. 
Display the current status of all three cards.
